*identification method discussion: 
General problem: we want an identification method which is trustable, secure and economical
	+sticking a paper with the barcode on the bracelet is not really possible, which can be damaged
	+user receive the unique code by email, print it, bring it to the event and receive a bracelet with the code ----> not economical
	+unique code -> bring the picture with the code -> checked in the event ----> can be stolen/dropped
	+the user receive the bracelet, we charge them for it, and after event the users return the bracelet -> can be used for next event
	+sticking a paper with the barcode on the bracelet -> can be damaged
	+(good idea) the visitors receive the code from the email, bring it to the event -> checking at the entrance -> visitors are charged for 4-5 euros for the bracelet with unique code, but the visitors MUST return it (or we can charge them more, with 9-10 euros so the visitors do not have to return them)
