applications GUIs:
-entrance-app (main entrance and event entrance are similar):

	+registration number is number which will be scanned from the barcode (which is received by email)
	+there is no possibility to pay at the entrance for the tickets or anything else
	+make it able to put money on eventaccount through website before event (possibly also during)

	+it should be possible to purchase multiple drinks and foods at once
	+shop items will also have barcodes, in order to save time and effort in the shop
