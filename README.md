# FeelGood Event System # 
##   - the first project of our studies. ##

The system holds several applications, which help to manage a festival, where each visitor has an unique RFID bracelet. 

### Website ###
On the website it is possible to see information about the event, register as visitor, purchase a ticket and organize accommodation with friends. Unfortunately, the database used is project is not active anymore.

### Application ###
Desktop applications take care of what's happening during the event: when entering or leaving, in the camping area, in the hardware borrowing station, foodtrucks etc.

#### Note that this repository also includes the documentation, as well as separate zip file for final deliverable. ####
