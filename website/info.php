     <h4>I LOST MY BRACELET, WHAT IS HAPPENING?</h4>
     <p>If you lost the bracelet with the chip you have to talk with the stuff to give you another one. This situation will unfortunately cost you 5 euros.</p>

     <h4>IF I BREAK SOME STUFF....?</h4>
     <p>Accidents happen and we understand that. The best solution is to avoid them happening and be carefully every moment but we know this is impossible. If you break or destroy some of our ecquipment you will have to pay it's price, it's easy :).</P>
     <br>
     <h4>MIGHT VIOLENCE AND INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOUR RUIN EVERYTHING?</h4>
     <p>The answer is not violence, never. So... if the temper is lost and raging is big, the stuff will have to take care of this somehow and a 30 fine will be applied.</p>
     <br>
     <h4>HOW DOES THE ENTRY SYSTEM WORK?</h4>
     <p>You will receive a bar code on your e-mail and you have to come with that one to the entrance. It can be printed or on your mobile phone. After that the stuff will scan it and will give you a bracelet which also represents your event-account. Be carefully with the bracelet in order not to be lost or taken by others.</p>
