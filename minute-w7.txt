Registration for the workshop, full is full.
KEEP THE WORKSHOPS SIMPLE!! - borrow the hardware from the computer doctor
Really good website.
First html cause it is simple and some things should be php but it's still good for this.

Setup should provide the information how everything works
Gotta do the database boays
After buying a ticket the visitor will receive an e=mail with a barcode that they will have to bring at the entrance. Then the visitor will receive a bracelet with a chip code and the barcode and chipcode will be connected

At the entrance we don't need balance or id. What we need is the barcode and then the chipcode. We have to be able to check carefully the barcodes: already/not yet checked in the event!!!(yes and no app to let them in)

What we have clear we write in the SETUP DOCUMENT(LIIS)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

An administration place where you can solve the problems

Quit button at the shop and message.
